# Coding-Duet


It really wasn't hard making my hair website for my client Chrystal, but I am happy that we had enough time to complete and make a finished website.  -Destiny Gross



I wish that we had more time to complete the project to make it better. My client is actually my partner's mom and she owns a hair salon and we think it'll be nice to make a website for her to expand her business. Another thing is that it was hard to keep going back and changing the code, but I really enjoyed making progress every week on my website.   -Essence Emerick
